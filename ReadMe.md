# Simple HTML5 / Javascript game

This is a simple single-player, multi-level game, which was put together for the purpose of getting my kids interested in programming. Didn't work, as in they didn't get interested. But here it is anyway.


# How to play

Red and green blobs fall from the sky. You jump around with the blue blob. Colliding with green blobs add points, but colliding with red blobs subtracts points. During level 1, you are allowed to temporarily go below zero, but in any higher level, that is game over. First click on Enter button starts the game. After that it toggles between Pause and Resume.

### Summary

* Avoid Red, Go for Green
* Space bar = Jump
* Enter = New Game / Pause / Resume
